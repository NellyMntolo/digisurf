If for some reason PMC importer fails, you can import the content manually also.


In that case please follow these steps:

- Install the Opus WordPress Theme
- Install Revolution slider and our shortcode/builder plugin (found in the plugins directory in the files for download)
- Import Demo content which is included with the Theme (in DEMO CONTENT directory)
- Import Demo Settings for the Revolution Slider - demo content is in the same directory as the demo content for WordPress
- Set up the Home Page in Reading -> Settings
- you might also have to set Menus locations under Appearance -> Menu -> Menu Settings
